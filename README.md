# Packista

This project was built with REACT as a pracice project to further my understanding on when and where to use state, 
how to use derived state, how to pass state and functions up and down the component tree, how to convert user input to state and how to apply my knowledge of array functions to the UI in order to handle tasks.

## Technologies

Built with React(js) and vanila CSS. Feedback and PRs are welcome.
